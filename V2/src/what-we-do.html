              <p>At Mac Outreach, we provide elementary and middle school students with a fun and safe environment to learn code.

              <h5>Activity Description</h5>
              <p>We will need 5 volunteers to play the role of
            binary digits, or bits, and help us count, which will
            lead to a surprising result.</p>
              <h5>Expected Outcomes</h5>
              <p>
                Zeros and Ones are the basis for computation in computers, and the system of numbers is called binary.
              </p>
              <h5>Pre-Trip Prep</h5>
              <p>
                We have found that the hands-on approach works without preparation.
              </p>
              <h5>Post-Trip Reinforcement</h5>
              <p>
                After the trip, it would be useful to show how numbers can be represented in different bases, including decimal and binary, and show how long addition works the same way in different bases.
              </p>
              <h5>Time Needed</h5>
              <p>

              <h5>Activity Description</h5>
              <p>Having seen binary numbers, we will now use an
          iPad game to show that pictures are encoded
          using binary numbers. Each child will create a
          black-and-white image and share it wirelessly
          with the other iPads, after which they will try to
          use their knowledge of binary to decode the
          images. It is quite possible to decode the images
          by guessing, but it is faster when some tricks are
          discovered based on understanding how numbers
          are represented (i.e. digit values grow from right
          to left, so it is easier to try “turning on” bigits from
          left to right, since once the bigits to the left are
          known, turning on the next bigit will either put the
          number over or not). Even kids who think they are
          not good at math usually figure this out in the
          context of the game, but we try to help the small
          number who need a bit of extra encouragement.</p>
              <h5>Expected Outcomes</h5>
              <p>
                All information we
          share or process
          digitally is encoded as
          binary numbers.
          Knowing the code, we
          can even decode
          small examples.
              </p>
              <h5>Pre-Trip Prep</h5>
              <p>
                Binary means base 2.
          They do not need to
          know this, but if they
          know about different
          bases, this will put it in
          context. Knowing the
          powers of 2
          (1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128) will
          help them.
              </p>
              <h5>Post-Trip Reinforcement</h5>
              <p>
                For classrooms with iPads,
          we have another app which
          shows how colour pictures
          are encoded, and allows the
          images to be edited by
          changing the numbers
          corresponding to pixel
          values.
              </p>
              <h5>Time Needed</h5>
              <p>
                20 - 60 minutes. <br />They can learn how to do the
binary decoding in 20 min,
and if you have it on your
iPads, they can come back
to this whenever they have
10 minutes left over at the
end of a period.

              <h5>Activity Description</h5>
              <p>Kids and supervisors will play the role of a dog’s
          stomach and a missing gold coin, as we try to
          figure out how to locate the coin using x-rays
          from multiple directions. If we are efficient, we
          can go on to decode the positions of bones and
          other tissues in the body.
          The computer in this case will be a whiteboard.</p>
              <h5>Expected Outcomes</h5>
              <p>
                An algorithm is a
          precise list of
          instructions, and even
          kids can figure one
          out. Some problems
          involve so much data,
          we need computers to
          solve them, in this
          case giving us a
          powerful medical tool.
              </p>
              <h5>Pre-Trip Prep</h5>
              <p>
                It would be helpful if the
          kids were reminded that
          light goes in straight
          lines and that there are
          kinds of light we cannot
          see, like x-rays. Doing
          SUDOKU problems in
          class will prime them for
          the type of logic they will
          need, and help them
          discover a workable
          algorithm themselves.
          We need to add the
          fractions
          1,1/2,1/4,1/8,1/16, so it
          might be worth
          practicing these.
              </p>
              <h5>Post-Trip Reinforcement</h5>
              <p>
                As a class or group activity,
          kids who previously did
          SUDOKU puzzles could try to
          write an algorithm (a step-bystep
          list of instructions) for
          solving a SUDOKU puzzle.
          Kids you need to keep busy
          for a couple of weeks could
          be asked to write an ELM
          program to solve SUDOKU
          puzzles.
              </p>
              <h5>Time Needed</h5>
              <p>
                20 min to 25 min per group of
          up to 16.
          Need a flip-chart, whiteboard
          or smart-board, and
          some separation from other
          children to prevent a
          feedback loop of talking over
          the other group.

              <h5>Activity Description</h5>
              <p>Using a web-based programming language we
          will all create graphics and animations, starting
          with some common challenges, but going on to
          whatever they can imagine.</p>
              <h5>Expected Outcomes</h5>
              <p>
                They will learn to write

          programming
          language, focussing
          on graphics, and

          choice in creating
          computer graphics in
          this activity, but if they
          are familiar with (x,y)
          coordinates, and with
          graphs of simple

          convenient for me to send
          two instructors for the day,
          and have them each visit one
          class in the morning and one
          in the afternoon. In addition
          to the instructor, we should
          have a few undergrad
          volunteers who can float
          between classes to help fix

              <h5>Activity Description</h5>
              <p>Pairs or triples of students will use tap and drag
          operations to create an adventure game, and they
          will see the structure of the game as a graph, and
          that some aspects of the game (such as whether
          it is impossible) can be decoded by examining the
          graph. We will also take a first look at adding
          functionality using a text language (like Python
          used in the pyVenture activity).</p>
              <h5>Expected Outcomes</h5>
              <p>
                A computer science
          graph is a set of points
          with a set of edges
          (lines) connecting
          them. It is probably
          the most important
          tool we have for
          representing
          information (such as
          the graph of Facebook
          friends!).

              <h5>Pre-Trip Prep</h5>
              <p>
                If you have studied a
          literary form (like haiku or
          the sonnet), they can
          write their adventure in
          this form, and you can
          suggest it as a challenge.
              </p>
              <h5>Post-Trip Reinforcement</h5>
              <p>
                There are many other
          examples of graphs, and the
          class should be able to come
          up with some examples. For
          fun, they could, on the board,
          draw the graph of who often
          eats lunch with whom. They
          could also use the internet to
          figure out which airports in
          Canada (or the World!) are
          connected by direct flights.
              </p>
              <h5>Time Needed</h5>
              <p>
                50 min to 120 min.
          They need about 15 minutes
          to understand the basics, but
          few can finish a playable
          game in under 50 minutes.
          The good creative writers
          won’t want to stop, but some
          children will need goals, such
          as creating 6 places in their
          game, or 6 keys, or creating
          2 dead-ends, etc.

              <h5>Post-Trip Reinforcement</h5>
              <p>
                A post-trip writing
          assignment would reinforce
          the discussion, with topics
          such as: Does cyberbullying
          have a solution in new
          software features, new laws
          or better awareness of
          bullying?
          Could networked information
          be used to reduce food
          waste and solve hunger in
          Canada?
