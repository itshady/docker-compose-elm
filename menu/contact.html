                                        Hi, my name is Levin. I am a Computer Science student at McMaster University, and I am currently in my third year. In my spare time, I like reading 
                                        novels, jogging, and writing code. My favourite fruits are watermelon and mango. I decided to join Computer
                                        Science because I enjoyed solving puzzles and finding the shortest solution to problems. So far 
                                        in computer science, I have enjoyed creating games and mobile apps. I'm also maintaining this website.

I am currently the Computer Science Rep. for McMaster's Women in Engineering Society, and VP Communications of the Computer Science Society. I love spending my free time hacking away at code, staying up late and eating lots of ice cream (not necessarily all at the same time)! I also love fencing (the sport), planning events, and helping out wherever I can! Feel free to send me an email!

I love Software and Computer Science because although I’m pretty terrible at drawing and painting, I can create new, amazing things just by typing out code. And that’s really cool! I’m also very passionate about learning new things and teaching others what I know. I like to create cool programs for my friends and family to use, and I’m learning about building and programming electronics using Raspberry Pi and Arduino kits. I also love biking, swimming, hiking and keeping up with my favourite TV shows. Well, trying to keep up! A few that come to mind are The Walking Dead, Stargate and Dark Matter. Don’t hesitate to email me if you have any questions or just want to chat! :)

                                        been interested in technology and building creative things, which is exactly what computer 
                                        science offers me. The fact that you can craft what comes to your mind through programming makes
                                        it endlessly interesting. 
                                        Aside from my hobby of playing music, enjoying myself on computers has always been an important
                                        part of my day. I hope that I can keep learning 
                                        what I can in this field, as well as inspire those hesitant to drive down this road.

                                        Hey guys! I'm majoring in Computer Science at McMaster University just like
                                        most of the instructors here. I love video games [any and all], sports [I do martial arts and 
                                        stunts], and photography [You can check me out at <a href=
                                        "https://jinsungleephotography.tumblr.com">JinSung Lee Photography (LeeJin)
                                        </a>]. I like computer science because I want to basically create programs (or robots) to 
                                        take over the world one day... One day. >:) #ICreatedThisWebsite

                                        computer science at McMaster                        
                                        University with all of the other instructors. I like skiing and chocolate ice cream. I like 
                                        pets, I have 3 dogs! I took computer science because I've seen how much easier computers make 
                                        our life, and I want to be a part of that. I look forward to seeing all of you!

                                        I graduated from Software Engineering at McMaster University, and also completed my 
                                        Masters in Computer Science. I love painting, piano, board games, and doing lunchtime crossword 
                                        puzzles.
