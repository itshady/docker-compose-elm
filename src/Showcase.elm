The format stayed similar to that of last year, with the comic being a narrative being told over the length of an eight panel comic. Students made use of various tools provided to them to create interactive comics. Students utilized the tracing tool to create shapes requiring complicated curves, text bubbles to show the dialogue between the characters and much more." ]
